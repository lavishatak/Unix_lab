EXCERCISE PROBLEMS:

step1: create a shell file for each of the operations to be performed as specified.

stp2: use sh file_name.sh,to view the output.

1. write a shell skript to check whether an entered number is positive or negative?
 PROGRAM:
 echo "enter the value of n"
 read n
 if test $n -gt 0
 then 
     echo "the number is positive"
 else 
     echo "the number is negative"
 fi

2. write a shell script to print the grade of the students based on their marks obtained?
 PROGRAM:
 echo "enter the marks obtained by the student"
 read m
 if test $m -ge 90
 then 
	echo "the grade of the student is A"
 elif test $m -ge 80
 then 
	echo "the grade of the student is B"
elif test $m -ge 70
 then 
	echo "the grade of the student is C"
elif test $m -ge 60
 then 
	echo "the grade of the student is D"
else 
	echo "sorry! the student has failed"
 fi

3. write a shell script to check whether the entered number is prime or not?
PROGRAM:
 count =0
 echo "enter a number"
 read n
 i=1
 for i in $( seq 1 $n )
 do
 	if [ `expr $n % $i` -eq 0 ]
     then
	count=$(($count+1))
 fi
 i=$(($i+1))
 done
 if test $count -eq 2
 then 
	echo "the number is prime"
 else
	echo "the number is not prime"
 fi
